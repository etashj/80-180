## Design features of language
[Hockett's Design Features of Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockett%27s_design_features)
##### 1. Vocal Auditory Channel
 - Speaking and hearing is the primary mode of communications for humans
 - Disregards sign language and alternate forms of communication
##### 2. Broadcast Transmission and Directional Perception
- Closer to a property of sound than language
- Location of speaker/language source is taking into account despite al sounds being broadcast to surroundings
##### 3. Rapid Fading Transmission (Transitoriness)
 - Sound is spoken and then disappear permanently
 - No redo/retry to hear words
##### 4. Interchangeability
 - You are able to communicate (speak and hear)
##### 5. Tonal Feedback
 - You can hear yourself speak and self-adjust
##### 6.  Specialization
 - Deliberate sharing of information rather than a byproduct of osme other response
##### 7. Semanticity
 - Specific sound signals are tied to meanings
##### 8. Arbitrariness
 - Words have no apparent link to their subjects
 - Exception may be onomatopoeia (but even that varies)
##### 9. Discreteness
- Despite being a contiunum we are able to separate discrete elemnts from speech. 
##### 10. Displacement
- There is context behind most speech but it may not be related to the environment/present
- You can talk about past, future, hypotehtical, etc. 
##### 11. Productivity
- Almost all sentences are unique and have not been said exactly the same way before
##### 12. Traditional/Cultural Transformation
 - 
##### 13. Duality of Patterning
 - You can analyze speech patterns at levels of the word, phrase, sentence, speech, etc. 


## Synchronic vs Diachronic
 - Synchronic: Current features of language (a snapshot in time)
 - Diachronic: The change of language over time
## Captured vs Inferred
 - Captured: Explicit meaning
 - Inferred: Inferred meaning + Implications
## E-Language vs I-Language
 - E-Land: Surface level info in the physical world an dhow its spoekn
 - I-Lang: Digging deeper to find out whats going on behind words and how the brain is processing langauge to producct E-Lang


## Topics
1. \[**2 classes**] Articulatory Phonetics
	Analysis of the sounds of langauge and how regular they are + mouth movements
2. \[**2 classes**] Acoustic phonetics
	Analysis of the sounds/frequencies of sounds
3. \[**4 classes**] Phonology
	The interaction between I-Langauge and E-Language (internal vs external realizations)
4. \[**2 classes**] Morphology
	What comes after phonology, connections of sounds
5. **Midterm :)**
6. \[**2 classes**] Morphology
7. \[**5 classes**] Syntax
8. \[**4 classes**] Historical
	Study of how languages change over time
